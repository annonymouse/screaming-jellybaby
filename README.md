# Make a Jelly Baby Scream!

**Introduction**
You will learn how to turn a Jelly Baby into an input device for your Raspberry Pi. You will then create a program to make it scream when it is pressed. 


## Step 1: Wire up a Jelly Baby

To begin you will need to turn a simple jelly baby into a switch by attaching cables to it and then connecting them to the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.

**You will need:**

**Activity Checklist:**

1. Take the metal paper clips and unfold them to make a straight wire.

2. Take a female to female jumper cable and push the paper clip wire into one of the ends. 

3. Do the same to the other wire so that you have two identical jumper cables with 

4. Insert the paper clips into a jelly baby so that they are close to each other but not touching. 

    Raspberry Pi GPIO header pins. The diagram above the pins shows the pin numbers. You will be using pin 3 and pin 25.

5. Take the other end of one of the jumper leads and push onto pin 3 of the General Purpose Input-Output (GPIO) header which is connected to one of the GPIO channels.

6. Take the end of the other jumper lead and push onto pin 25 of the GPIO header which is connected to ground.

    **Warning!** You can damage your Raspberry Pi if you do not use the GPIO pins correctly!
